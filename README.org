:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Delete whitespace between words, parenthesis and other delimiters in a smart (dumb) way.

Suppose you have this text in the buffer:

[[./doc/demo-00-01.png]]

With =smart-hungry-delete/backward-char=, it will delete all but one (white-)space between =word= and =paren=:


[[./doc/demo-00-02.png]]

If you delete here:


[[./doc/demo-00-03.png]]

it deletes all whitespace, because it's on the inside of a paren:

[[./doc/demo-00-04.png]]

Inside of right paren:

[[./doc/demo-00-05.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-06.png]]

This is configured for =C=-like languages (e.g. Python), where =:= usually has no space to the left:

[[./doc/demo-00-07.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-08.png]]

It has space to the right though:

[[./doc/demo-00-09.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-10.png]]

This also works for (nested) parentheses:

[[./doc/demo-00-11.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-12.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-13.png]]

Between words it will leave a space:

[[./doc/demo-00-14.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-15.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-16.png]]

It's in [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]], so if you have that in your package lists, just =M-x= =package-install= =smart-hungry-delete=, and bind =smart-hungry-delete-backward-char= and =smart-hungry-delete-forward-char=:
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'smart-hungry-delete)
(smart-hungry-delete-add-default-hooks)
(smart-hungry-delete-should-add-kill-ring t)

If you use =use-package=:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package smart-hungry-delete
  :ensure t
  :bind (([remap backward-delete-char-untabify] . smart-hungry-delete-backward-char)
           ([remap delete-backward-char] . smart-hungry-delete-backward-char)

Only for some modes:
#+begin_src elisp

  :bind (:map python-mode-map
              ([remap backward-delete-char-untabify] . smart-hungry-delete-backward-char)

* Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       02237111-db5b-4d2b-a23a-0ac78c7d80b8
:END:

smart-hungry-delete deletes hungrily if three regexps match:

#+begin_src
<left><kill>(point)<right>
#+end_src

or with =smart-hungry-delete-forward-char=:

#+begin_src
<left>(point)<kill><right>
#+end_src

You can configure these on a per buffer basis:

=smart-hungry-delete-char-kill-regexp= is a buffer-local variable holding a regex that defines what will be hungrily deleted (<kill>).

=smart-hungry-delete-char-trigger-killall-regexps= is a list of pairs:

#+begin_src elisp
'(("\\[" . ".") ;; delete when <left> is "[" and <right> is any of "."
  ("." . "\\]") ;; delete when <left> is any of "." and <right> is "]"
  ...)
#+end_src

=smart-hungry-delete-add-regexps-left-right= makes it easy to add left-right combinations of chars like parentheses:

#+begin_src elisp
(smart-hungry-delete-add-regexps-left-right "\\{" "\\}") ;;as above, but with "{" and "}"
#+end_src


=smart-hungry-delete-add-default-hooks= will add some good defaults for (some) programming modes. Check out the =smart-hungry-delete-default-*-hook= functions.

=smart-hungry-delete-should-add-kill-ring= will change whether the deleted regions is added to `kill ring` or not. Default `t`.

If you have good suggestions for more defaults, make sure to [[https://github.com/hrehfeld/emacs-smart-hungry-delete/issues][suggest the recipes!]]
